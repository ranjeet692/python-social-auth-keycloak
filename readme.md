# Python-Social-Auth Keycloak BackendCreated this file with the help of keycloak documentation and other oauth2 files from python social auth backend. The default keycloak.py was not working with open-edx third party authentication.You can replace this in the library or rename the filename and class name and use it. Tested with open-edx ironwood 2.6
